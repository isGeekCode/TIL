            A collection of concrete writeups of small things I learn daily while working
            and researching. My goal is to work in public. I was inspired to start this
            repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and he was
            apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].
